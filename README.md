## ðŸš€ Tech

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- REACT
- TAILWIND CSS



## ðŸ’» Project

This is a website that allows any person to visualize the iterations in every single sorting algorithm that is worth learning

The user is able to select a sorting algorithm, select a list of numbers and run the app

The iterations interface will display to the user every single iteration that happens in the algorithm
